## Hi, I'm Kevin!

I'm a current senior at Northeastern University studying Computer Science (Software), and
looking to graduate in 2026. I've previously worked at Northeastern University ITS as a Junior ServiceNow 
Software Developer and at AA Technology as a Software Engineer Intern.

I have a strong passion for creating projects that people actually use. Whether it's a second saved
everyday, or a minute, or an hour, I wish to build products that make people's lives easier.
